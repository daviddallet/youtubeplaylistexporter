#   .env.production  - used by `npm run build` (deployed sites)
#
# Copy this file to create both:
#   cp .env.example .env.development
#   cp .env.example .env.production

# Throttle Configuration (optional)
#
# These settings control client-side rate limiting for YouTube API calls.
# Only adjust these if you understand the quota implications.
#
# VITE_THROTTLE_THRESHOLD: Quota points consumed in last 60s before throttling kicks in
# VITE_MAX_QUOTA_PER_MINUTE: Maximum quota consumption per minute
#
# Important: MAX_QUOTA_PER_MINUTE - THROTTLE_THRESHOLD should be >= 60
# to ensure at least 1 request per second can proceed during throttling.
#
# VITE_THROTTLE_THRESHOLD=30
# VITE_MAX_QUOTA_PER_MINUTE=90

# Policy Files Configuration (required)
#
# These settings control the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy pages.
# Files are loaded from the ../legal/ directory with language suffix.
#
# Example: If VITE_POLICY_TERMS=policy and user language is French,
# the app will try to load ../legal/policy.fr.md, falling back to
# ../legal/policy.en.md if not found.
#
# Set to "none" to disable policy links (shows a demo warning instead).
# Build will fail if these are not set, or if English file is missing
# (unless value is "none").
#
VITE_POLICY_TERMS=none
VITE_POLICY_PRIVACY=none
